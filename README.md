This project explores the implementation of Morse code encoding and decoding as part of a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) lab exercise, utilizing both MATLAB and Python on a Raspberry Pi 5. The objective was to design, simulate, and analyse a system capable of generating and interpreting Morse code signals, which are represented by standardized patterns of short and long pulses (dots and dashes).
For the encoding phase, input text is translated into corresponding Morse code audio signals using MATLAB. The system generates audio waveforms representing dots and dashes with precise timing intervals, adhering to international Morse code standards. The encoded audio is stored in a .wav file format, ensuring compatibility with standard audio analysis tools.
In the decoding phase, Python was employed on a Raspberry Pi 5 to analyse and interpret the audio signals. A robust signal processing pipeline was implemented to detect and distinguish dots and dashes from the audio, taking into account noise and timing variations. The decoded output is displayed as text, completing the Morse code communication process.
The integration of MATLAB for encoding and Python on Raspberry Pi for decoding highlights the practical applications of DSP techniques in embedded systems. The project demonstrates key DSP concepts such as waveform generation, signal analysis, and time-domain signal processing. Additionally, the utilization of Raspberry Pi 5 exemplifies the implementation of real-world signal processing applications on resource-constrained devices.
The project culminates in a system that not only reinforces fundamental DSP concepts but also provides a foundation for exploring advanced topics, such as error handling in noisy environments and the use of machine learning for automated signal classification. The findings and methodologies presented offer insights into the intersection of DSP, embedded systems, and communication technologies.
